If you haven't configure your aws client yet make sure you do before trying to deploy.

To do so, install the AWS command line following this: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html

Configure your credentials through the command `aws configure`. Get/Generate your Access Key ID and your Secret Access Key from the AWS IAM service.
