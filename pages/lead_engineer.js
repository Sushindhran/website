                <h3>About the Position:</h3>
                <p className="sm-text-justify">We are looking for trend-setting and cutting edge
                  technology leaders to join our consulting team at Neosavvy. We strive to
                  educate our clients and lead them into uncharted territories in technology.
                  We want to partner with others who have a proven track record of managing
                  technical direction and technical colleagues to help solve our customers
                  business problems. Our customers trust us, and we need highly skilled team mates
                  to help further and maintain our relationships.</p>

                <h3>About You:</h3>
                <p className="sm-text-justify">You have a proven track record of managing small teams and
                  possibly numerous stakeholders who look to you for solutions to open ended business
                  problems. You additionally can demonstrate a solid understanding of full stack
                  development in HTML/CSS/Javascript hooked into a Scala, Java, Python or
                  Rails JSON/REST-ful API. You (like us) currently focus on Javascript frontend development,
                  but also have an interest in projects with Scala, Java, or Python backends exposed
                  as REST-ful services.</p>

                <h3>About Us:</h3>
                <p>We’re proud of the work we do at Neosavvy. It’s dynamic,
                  engaging and challenges us to learn, do, and share more. We
                  provide software solutions that fit our clients’ practical
                  and aesthetic needs. We offer training, consulting, project
                  planning, delivery, and management services.</p>

                <p>We consider ourselves active members of the engineering community.
                  In a collaborative spirit, we strive to share with others what
                  we learn from our work. This is also why we have high standards
                  (and great benefits) for our Neosavvy employees.</p>


                <p>All Neosavvy team members earn competitive salaries, receive free
                  lunches, and participation in company sponsored events.</p>
